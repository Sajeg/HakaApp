I know High seas is soon over, but you can still use [Hakatime](https://waka.hackclub.com) afterwards. That's why I created:

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project that aims to be an alternative way to see the programming time collected by [Hakatime](https://waka.hackclub.com)

Features:
* Cross platform: Works on the [Web](https://haka.sajeg.org), Android and as a Desktop App
* Advanced Filters: You can Filter after Projects, Editors, Machines and more
* App like experience in the web: You can also just add the website as PWA to your Phone's home screen.
